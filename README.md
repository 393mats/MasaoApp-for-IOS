# MasaoApp for iOS
MasaoApp is the project of smartphone application for the very ~~famous~~ tradtional parody web game __"SuperMasao"__. Original Masao Construction for Java is developed by [Naoto Fukuda](http://www.t3.rim.or.jp/~naoto/naoto.html), and JSMasao is ported by [Ryo](http://ryo-9399.github.io/).  
The base of game editor is the new version of  [BAMP](http://tex1.symphonic-net.com/bamp/about.html) which has been developed using HTML5 and CSS3. In this app, Webview component is put full-page for that. Also background layer and some functions is excluded from app. There are 2 reasons why I did that. One is for attracted to some people who wants to make more original game. And another one is I was just lazy to implement.
